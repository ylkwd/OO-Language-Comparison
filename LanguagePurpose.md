# Language purpose/genesis
* **Java** is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let all compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support **Java** without the need for recompilation.
* **Swift** is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, complied programming language developed by *Apple.inc* for *iOS*, *macOS*, *watchOS*, *tvOS*, and *linux*. **Swift** is intended to be more resilient to erroneous code ("safer") than *Objective-C*, and more concise. However it supports many core concepts that are associated with *Objective-C*.
