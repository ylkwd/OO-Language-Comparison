# Namespaces
* **Java** has a *package* containing a named collection of classes. To specify the *package* a class is to be part of, developers use a package directive. All code belongs to a package, although that package need not be explicitly named. Code from other packages is accessed by prefixing the package name before the appropriate identifier, for example `class String` in package `java.lang` can be referred to as `java.lang.String` (this is known as the fully qualified class name). 
```java
package fibsandlies;
import java.util.HashMap;
```


* **Swift** introduces true named parameters and retains key Objective-C concepts, including protocols, closures and categories, often replacing former syntax with cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to other language structures, like enumerated types (enums).
```swift
module ActiveRecord
	class Base
	
	end
end
```
```switf
enum ColorPalette {
    static let Red = UIColor(red: 1.0, green: 0.1491, blue: 0.0, alpha: 1.0)
    static let Green = UIColor(red: 0.0, green: 0.5628, blue: 0.3188, alpha: 1.0)
    static let Blue = UIColor(red: 0.0, green: 0.3285, blue: 0.5749, alpha: 1.0)
}
```
