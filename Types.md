# Types
* **Java** supports eight basic data types known as *Primitive Types*. These eight types include 
	* byte
	* short
	* int
	* long
	* float
	* double
	* boolean
	* char
  ```java
    byte a = 68;
    char a = 'A'

   int decimal = 100;
   int octal = 0144;
   int hexa =  0x64;

   "Hello World"
   "two\nlines"
   "\"This is in quotes\""


   char a = '\u0001';
   String a = "\u0001";
    
  ```





* **Swift** offers the programmer a rich assortment of built-in as well as user-defined data types. The following types of basic data types are most frequently when declaring variables −
	* Int or UInt − This is used for whole numbers. More specifically, you can use Int32, Int64 to define 32 or 64 bit signed integer, whereas UInt32 or UInt64 to define 32 or 64 bit unsigned integer variables.
	* Float − This is used to represent a 32-bit floating-point number and numbers with smaller decimal points. For example, 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.158.
	* Double − This is used to represent a 64-bit floating-point number and used when floating-point values must be very large. For example, 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.158.
	* Bool − This represents a Boolean value which is either true or false.
	* String − This is an ordered collection of characters. For example, "Hello, World!"
	* Character − This is a single-character string literal. For example, “C”.
	* Optional − This represents a variable that can hold either a value or no value.
  
  
  
  ```swift
  typealias newname = type
  typealias Feet = Int
  
  import Cocoa

  typealias Feet = Int
  var distance: Feet = 100
  println(distance)
  ```
