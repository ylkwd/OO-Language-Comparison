# Unique features of the language

* **Java** has five primary features:
	1. It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".
	2. It must be "robust and secure".
	3. It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".
	4. It must execute with "high performance".
	5. It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".
* **Swift** is an alternative to the Objective-C language that employs modern programming-language theory concepts and strives to present a simpler syntax. During its introduction, it was described simply as "Objective-C without the C". By default, **Swift** does not expose pointers and other unsafe accessors, in contrast to Objective-C, which uses pointers pervasively to refer to object instances. Also, Objective-C's use of a Smalltalk-like syntax for making method calls has been replaced with a dot-notation style and namespace system more familiar to programmers from other common object-oriented (OO) languages like Java or C#. Swift introduces true named parameters and retains key Objective-C concepts, including protocols, closures and categories, often replacing former syntax with cleaner versions and allowing these concepts to be applied to other language structures, like enumerated types (enums).
