## Definition of Procedural programming
 A programming paradigm based upon the concept of procedure call such as routines, subroutines, or functions. Procedural programming is list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. It's executing the codes from top to button which is so-called top-down languages. C language is a good example of Procedural programming.

## Procedural:
 * One of the most important characteristic is to rely on procedures that operates on data.  

 * Everything is done in a specific order.

 * Execution of a routine may have side effects.

 * Tends to emphasize implementing solutions in a linear fashion.

## Does Java support Procedural programming?
No. Java is a pure Object-Oriented programming, where all computations are carried out using object, which is component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program. Method and variable have to reside in Class. Procedures and data are all bundling into Object in OOP.


A simple print statement shows below:
```Java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```
This only works in a class.

## Does Swift support Procedural programming?
No. Swift is also an Object-Oriented programming. It does have some other features that differ from Java. However, The fundamental component of Object-Oriented concept is still kept in Swift language.

A simple print statement shows below:
``` Swift
print("Hello World")
```
This also can only be allowed within a class, a struct, or a enum.

## Conclusion
Java and Swift are not supporting Procedural programming because both of them are Object-Oriented programming, which takes method(procedure) and property(data) in the class. We cannot create a procedure without using Class.
